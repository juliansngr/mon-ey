Further information can be found at [www.manualof.me](https://www.manualof.me).

**Hints to help you complete this**:

1. Don’t rush - take some time to think about your answers.
2. Be honest - don’t describe the person you want to be, but the person you are.
3. Ask others - get input from the people around you.
4. Keep it fresh - return to your manual and see if things have changed.
